# otlang
otlang – a simple interpreter for drawing on a 512x512 canvas that only understands commands made of zeros and ones.
Made simply out of boredom; this project is unlikely to be developed further. (besides brushes, there's nothing more to add here anyway...)
You can also take the source code and extend it, or even rewrite the interpreter to work with symbols :)

## Installation
1. Download the archive from the [releases](https://github.com/xerooup/otlang/releases)
2. Unpack it to the desired location
3. Create .ot (or any other) file next to the interpreter, containing your code

## Getting started
